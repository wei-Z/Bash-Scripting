# Bash-Scripting
Based on most upvoted answer from this **Quora topic**:[What are some good shell scripting projects for beginners?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-shell-scripting-projects-for-beginners)


To learn the basics of shell scripting, first scrape data from a website and then get the data in a structured format.

Giving a shot at Yahoo Finance Data. Here is the link for historical data for Google (GOOG) : [Google Inc. Stock - Yahoo! India Finance](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history?ltr=1). There is tabular data  on this page. 
1. First try and scrape the data and store it as a csv in the same format as given on the link. This would involve using all basic shell commands. 

2. Once this is done, try taking input from the user and write a general script to parse data for any stock.

3. Further you can use AWK scripts to get a summary of this data (basically min, max, avg etc).

Hopefully once these steps are done, decent enough knowledge about shell scripting can be gained.
